This is a simple story idea generator that creates a short two-sentence story synopsis based on four user-provided words: Time, Place, Character, and Item. The story structure is built from predefined sentence templates, and each generation randomly selects one template. I originally planned to integrate DeepSeek embeddings to make the program more intelligent, but it appears that approach requires paid access.
